My name is Jannik ZÃ¼rn and I am a Ph.D. student in robotics at the [Autonomous Intelligent Systems lab](https://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de) under the supervision of Prof. Wolfram Burgard at the University of Freiburg, Germany.

For my PhD I work on autonomous urban navigation for pedestrian robots. In my research, I aim at bringing Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, especially Deep Learning, closer together. My goal is to enable autonomous robots to better understand their surroundings with the sensors they have and to allow them to more accurately and robustly navigate through those surroundings; especially in precence of adversarial influences such as sensor noise, uncertainties, and occlusion. Self-supervised learning with multiple sensor modalities plays a particularly important role in this endeavour as it allows us to avoid expensive and time-consuming labeling of data which is necessary for standard supervised learning.

## Research Statement

In my daily reseach I aim at bringing Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, especially Deep Learning, closer together. My goal is to enable autonomous robots to better understand their surroundings with the sensors they have and to allow them to more accurately and robustly navigate through those surroundings in precence of adversarial influences such as sensor noise, uncertainties, and occlusion. Self-supervised learning with multiple sensor modalities plays a particularly important role in this endeavour as it allows us to avoid expensive and time-consuming labeling of data which is necessary for standard supervised learning.
